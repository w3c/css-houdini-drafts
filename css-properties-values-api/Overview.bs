Introduction {#intro}
=====================

CSS defines a comprehensive set of properties that can be manipulated in order
to modify the layout, paint, or behaviour of a web document. However, web authors
frequently wish to extend this set with additional properties.

[[css-variables]] provides primitive means for defining user-controlled properties,
however these properties always take token lists as values, must always inherit, and
can only impact document layout or paint by being re-incorporated into the value
of other properties via a var() reference.

This specification extends [[css-variables]], allowing the registration of properties
that have a value type, an initial value, and a defined inheritance behaviour.

This specification is complementary to [[css-paint-api-1]] and [[css-layout-api-1]], which
allow custom properties to directly impact paint and layout behaviours respectively.

Registering custom properties {#registering-custom-properties}
==============================================================

<pre class='idl'>
dictionary PropertyDescriptor {
	required DOMString name;
	         DOMString syntax       = "*";
	required boolean   inherits;
	         DOMString initialValue;
};

partial namespace CSS {
	void registerProperty(PropertyDescriptor descriptor);
};
</pre>

Additional, the {{Document}} object gains a new <dfn attribute for=Window>\[[registeredPropertySet]]</dfn> private slot,
which is a set of records that describe registered custom properties.

The {{PropertyDescriptor}} dictionary {#the-propertydescriptor-dictionary}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A <dfn dictionary>PropertyDescriptor</dfn> dictionary represents author-specified configuration
options for a custom property. {{PropertyDescriptor}} dictionaries contain the
following members:

:   <dfn dict-member for=PropertyDescriptor>name</dfn>
::  The name of the custom property being defined.

:   <dfn dict-member for=PropertyDescriptor>syntax</dfn>
::  A string representing how this custom property is parsed.

:   <dfn dict-member for=PropertyDescriptor>inherits</dfn>
::  True if this custom property should inherit down the DOM tree; False otherwise.

:   <dfn dict-member for=PropertyDescriptor>initialValue</dfn>
::  The initial value of this custom property.

The {{registerProperty()}} function {#the-registerproperty-function}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The <dfn method for=CSS>registerProperty(PropertyDescriptor descriptor)</dfn> method
registers a custom property according to the configuration options provided in
<code>descriptor</code>.
When it is called,
it executes the <a>register a custom property</a> algorithm,
passing the options in its <code>descriptor</code> argument
as arguments of the same names.

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>register a custom property</dfn>
	with |name| being a string,
	and optionally
	|syntax| being a string,
	|inherits| being a boolean,
	and |initialValue| being a string,
	execute these steps:

	1. Let |property set|
		be the value of the
		<a>current global object's</a>
		<a>associated <code>Document</code></a>'s
		{{[[registeredPropertySet]]}} slot.

	2. Attempt to parse |name|
		as a <<custom-property-name>>.
		If this fails,
		<a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}
		and exit this algorithm.

		Otherwise,
		let |parsed name| be the parsed value.

		If |property set|
		already contains an entry with |parsed name| as its property name
		(compared codepoint-wise),
		<a>throw</a> an {{InvalidModificationError}}
		and exit this algorithm.

	3. Attempt to [=consume a syntax descriptor=] from |syntax|.
		If it returns failure, <a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}.
		Otherwise, let |syntax descriptor| be the returned <a>syntax descriptor</a>.

	4. If |syntax descriptor| is the <a>universal syntax descriptor</a>,
		and |initialValue| is not present,
		let |parsed initial value| be empty.
		This must be treated identically to the "default" initial value of custom properties,
		as defined in [[!css-variables]].
		Skip to the next step of this algorithm.

		Otherwise,
		if |syntax descriptor| is the <a>universal syntax descriptor</a>,
		[=CSS/parse=] |initialValue| as a <<declaration-value>>.
		If this fails,
		<a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}
		and exit this algorithm.
		Otherwise,
		let |parsed initial value| be the parsed result.
		Skip to the next step of this algorithm.

		Otherwise, if |initialValue| is not present,
		<a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}
		and exit this algorithm.

		Otherwise,
		[=CSS/parse=] {{PropertyDescriptor/initialValue}}
		according to |syntax descriptor|.
		If this fails,
		<a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}
		and exit this algorithm.

		Otherwise, let |parsed initial value| be the parsed result.
		If |parsed initial value| is not <a>computationally independent</a>,
		<a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}}
		and exit this algorithm.

	5. Set |inherit flag| to the value of |inherits|.

	6. Let |registered property| be a [=struct=]
		with a property name of |parsed name|,
		a syntax of |syntax descriptor|,
		an initial value of |parsed initial value|,
		and an inherit flag of |inherit flag|.
		[=set/Append=] |registered property|
		to |property set|.
</div>

A property value is <dfn export>computationally independent</dfn>
if it can be converted into a computed value
using only the value of the property on the element,
and "global" information that cannot be changed by CSS.

<div class='example'>
	For example, ''5px'' is <a>computationally independent</a>,
	as converting it into a computed value doesn't change it at all.
	Similarly, ''1in'' is <a>computationally independent</a>,
	as converting it into a computed value
	relies only on the "global knowledge" that ''1in'' is ''96px'',
	which can't be altered or adjusted by anything in CSS.

	On the other hand, ''3em'' is not <a>computationally independent</a>,
	because it relies on the value of 'font-size' on the element
	(or the element's parent).
	Neither is a value with a ''var()'' function,
	because it relies on the value of a <a>custom property</a>.
</div>

When a custom property is registered with a given type,
the process via which specified values for that property are turned into computed values
is defined fully by the type selected,
as described in [[#calculation-of-computed-values]].

	Note: A way to unregister properties may be added in the future.

Registering a custom property must <strong>not</strong> affect the [=cascade=] in any way.
Regardless of what syntax is specified for a registered property,
at parse time it is still parsed as normal for a [=custom property=],
accepting nearly anything.
If the [=specified value=] for a registered [=custom property=]
violates the registered syntax,
however,
the property becomes [=invalid at computed-value time=]
(and thus resets to the registered initial value).

<div class='example'>
	By default, all custom property declarations that can be parsed as a sequence of tokens
	are valid. Hence, the result of this stylesheet:

	<pre class='lang-css'>
	.thing {
		--my-color: green;
		--my-color: url("not-a-color");
		color: var(--my-color);
	}
	</pre>

	is to set the 'color' property of elements of class "thing" to ''inherit''.
	The second '--my-color' declaration overrides the first at parse time (both are valid),
	and the ''var()'' reference in the 'color' property is found to be <a spec=css-variables>invalid at computed-value time</a>
	(because ''url("not-a-color")'' is not a color).
	At this stage of the CSS pipeline (computation time),
	the only available fallback is the initial value of the property,
	which in the case of color is ''inherit''.
	Although there was a valid usable value (green),
	this was removed during parsing because it was superseded by the URL.

	If we call:

	<pre class='lang-javascript'>
	CSS.registerProperty({
		name: "--my-color",
		syntax: "&lt;color>",
		initialValue: "black",
		inherits: false
	});
	</pre>

	the parsing doesn't significantly change,
	regardless of whether the registration occurs before or after the stylesheet above.
	The only difference is that it's the '--my-color' property that becomes [=invalid at computed-value time=] instead
	and gets set to its initial value of ''black'';
	then 'color' is validly set to ''black'',
	rather than being [=invalid at computed-value time=]
	and becoming ''inherit''.
</div>

Calculation of Computed Values {#calculation-of-computed-values}
----------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax of a custom property fully determines how computed values are
generated from specified values for that property.

The <a>CSS-wide keywords</a> and ''revert'' generate computed values as
described in [[!css3-values]] and [[!css-cascade-4]] respectively. Otherwise:

For &lt;length> values, the computed value is the absolute length expressed in pixels.

For &lt;length-percentage> values, the computed value is one of the following:
*   if the specified value contains only length units, the computed value is the absolute length
	expressed in pixels.
*   if the specified value contains only percentages, the computed value is a
	simple percentage.
*   otherwise, the computed value is a calc expression containing an absolute
	length expressed in pixels, and a percentage value.

For &lt;color> values, the value is computed as described in
	[[css-color-4#resolving-color-values]].

For &lt;angle>, &lt;time> and &lt;resolution> values, the computed value is the
value expressed in its [=canonical unit=], with ''calc()'' expressions
evaluated [[css-values-4#calc-computed-value|as described in CSS Values]].

For &lt;custom-ident>, ident, or "*" values, the computed value is as specified.

For &lt;url> values, the computed value is one of the following:

*   if the URL is a relative URL, the computed value is the resolved absolute URL
    as described in [[!css3-values]].
*   otherwise, the computed value is as specified.

For &lt;image> values, the computed value is as specified, except that relative
URLs that appear in the value are resolved to absolute URLs as described in
[[!css3-values]], and all lengths are resolved to their computed values.

For &lt;integer>, &lt;number> and &lt;percentage> values, the computed value is
one of the following:

* if the specified value is a ''calc()'' expression, the computed value is the
	evaluated result of that expression.
* otherwise, the computed value is as specified.

For &lt;transform-function> values (including those contained in &lt;transform-list> values),
the computed value is as specified but with all lengths resolved to their
computed values.

For values specified by a syntax string that include "|" clauses, the computed
value is given by applying the calculation rules for the first clause that
matches to the specified value.

For list values, the computed value is a list of the computed values of the
primitives in the list.


Registered Properties and @supports {#supports}
-----------------------------------------------

Unregistered custom properties are “always valid”
when tested via ''@supports'';
a rule like `@supports (--foo: red) {...}`
is always true
so long as you don't violate the (very liberal) syntax for custom properties.

Registering a custom property does not change this.
Even if a custom property is, for example,
registered with `syntax: "&lt;color>"`,
a rule like `@supports (--foo: 1em) {...}`
will still evaluate as true and apply those styles.

Note: This matches the parsing behavior of registered custom properties.
A registered custom property specified as `"&lt;color>"`
but written as `--foo: 1em;` will still be accepted as valid at parse-time,
but be automatically [=invalid at computed-value time=].
As ''@supports'' tests parse behavior,
it thus also accepts all values as valid regardless of the registered syntax.

Dependency cycles via relative units {#dependency-cycles}
---------------------------------------------------------

Registered custom properties follow the same rules for dependency cycle
resolution as unregistered custom properties, with the following additional
constraints:

For any registered custom property with a <<length>> or <<length-percentage>> syntax
component:

* If the property contains any of the following units:
	''em'', ''ex'', ''cap'', ''ch'', ''ic'', ''lh'';
	then add an edge between the property and the ''font-size'' of the current
	element.
* If the property contains the ''lh'' unit,
	add an edge between the property and the ''line-height'' of the current
	element.
* If the property contains any of the following units: ''rem'', ''rlh'';
	then add an edge between the property
	and the 'font-size'' of the root element.
* If the property contains the ''rlh'' unit, add an edge between the property
	and the 'line-height'' of the root element.

<div class='example'>
	For example, given this registration:

	<pre class='lang-javascript'>
	CSS.registerProperty({
	  name: "--my-font-size",
	  syntax: "&lt;length>",
	  initialValue: "0px",
	  inherits: false
	});
	</pre>

	the following will produce a dependency cycle:

	<pre class='lang-css'>
	div {
		--my-font-size: 10em;
		font-size: var(--my-font-size);
	}
	</pre>

	and ''font-size'' will behave as if the value ''unset'' was specified.
</div>


Syntax Strings {#syntax-strings}
================================

A <dfn>syntax string</dfn> describes the value types accepted by a registered
custom property. Syntax strings consists of
[=syntax component names=], that are
optionally [[#multipliers|multiplied]] and [[#combinator|combined]].

A syntax string can be parsed into a <a>syntax descriptor</a>, which is either:

	1. A list of <a>syntax components</a>, each of which accept the value types
		specified in [[#supported-names]], or
	2. The <a>universal syntax descriptor</a> ('*'), which accepts any valid token
		stream.

Note: Regardless of the syntax specified, all custom properties accept
<a>CSS-wide keywords</a>, and process these values
appropriately.

<div class='example'>
	For example, the following are all valid syntax strings.

	:   <code>"&lt;length>"</code>
	::  accepts length values
	:   <code>"&lt;length> | &lt;percentage>"</code>
	::  accepts lengths, percentages, percentage calc expressions, and length calc
		expressions, but not calc expressions containing a combination of length
		and percentage values.
	:   <code>"&lt;length-percentage>"</code>
	::  accepts all values that <code>"&lt;length> | &lt;percentage>"</code> would
		accept, as well as calc expressions containing a combination of both length
		and percentage values.
	:   <code>"big | bigger | BIGGER"</code>
	::  accepts the ident <code>big</code>, or the ident <code>bigger</code>, or
		the ident <code>BIGGER</code>.
	:   <code>"&lt;length>+"</code>
	::  accepts a space-separated list of length values.
	:   "*"
	::  accepts any valid token stream
</div>

Note: The internal grammar of syntax strings is a subset of
[[css-values-3#value-defs|the CSS Value Definition Syntax]]. Future levels of this specification are expected
to expand the complexity of the allowed grammar, allowing custom properties
that more closely resemble the full breadth of what CSS properties allow.

The remainder of this chapter describes the internal grammar of the syntax
strings.

Supported names {#supported-names}
----------------------------------

This section defines the <dfn for=CSS lt="supported syntax component name">supported syntax component names</dfn>, and the
corresponding types accepted by the resulting <a>syntax component</a>.

:   "&lt;length>"
::  Any valid <<length>> value
:   "&lt;number>"
::  <<number>> values
:   "&lt;percentage>"
::  Any valid <<percentage>> value
:   "&lt;length-percentage>"
::  Any valid <<length>> or <<percentage>> value, any valid <<calc()>>
	expression combining <<length>> and <<percentage>> components.
:   "&lt;color>"
::  Any valid <<color>> value
:   "&lt;image>"
::  Any valid <<image>> value
:   "&lt;url>"
::  Any valid <<url>> value
:   "&lt;integer>"
::  Any valid <<integer>> value
:   "&lt;angle>"
::  Any valid <<angle>> value
:   "&lt;time>"
::  Any valid <<time>> value
:   "&lt;resolution>"
::  Any valid <<resolution>> value
:   "&lt;transform-function>"
::  Any valid <<transform-function>> value
:   "&lt;custom-ident>"
::  Any valid <<custom-ident>> value
:   Any sequence which [[css-syntax-3#would-start-an-identifier|starts an identifier]],
		[[css-syntax-3#consume-name|can be consumed as a name]], and matches the <<custom-ident>> production
::  That identifier

		Note: <<custom-ident>>s are compared codepoint-wise with each other;
		this is different than the normal behavior of UA-defined CSS
		which limits itself to ASCII
		and is <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a>.
		So, specifying an ident like <code>Red</code>
		means that the precise value ''Red'' is accepted;
		''red'', ''RED'', and any other casing variants are not matched by this.
		It is recommended that idents be restricted to ASCII and written in lower-case,
		to match CSS conventions.

:   "&lt;transform-list>"
::  A list of valid <<transform-function>> values. Note that
		<code>"&lt;transform-list>"</code> is a <a>pre-multiplied data type name</a>
		equivalent to <code>"&lt;transform-function>+"</code>

Note: A syntax string of <code>"*"</code> will produce the
	<a>universal syntax descriptor</a>, which is not a <a>syntax component</a>.
	Therefore, <code>"*"</code> may not be [[#multipliers|multiplied]] or
	[[#combinator|combined]] with anything else.

The '+' and '#' multipliers {#multipliers}
------------------------------------------

Any <a>syntax component name</a> except
<a>pre-multiplied data type names</a> may be immediately followed by a multiplier:

:   U+002B PLUS SIGN (+)
::  Indicates a space-separated list.

:   U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#)
::  Indicates a comma-separated list.

<div class='example'>
	:   <code>"&lt;length>+"</code>
	::  accepts a space-separated list of length values
	:   <code>"&lt;color>#"</code>
	::  accepts a comma-separated list of color values
</div>

Note: The multiplier must appear immediately after the <a>syntax component name</a>
being multiplied.

The '|' combinator {#combinator}
--------------------------------

<a>Syntax strings</a> may use U+007C VERTICAL LINE (|) to provide multiple
<a>syntax component names</a>. Such syntax strings will result in a
<a>syntax descriptor</a> with multiple <a>syntax components</a>.

When a <a>syntax descriptor</a> with multiple <a>syntax components</a> is used
to parse a CSS value, the syntax components are matched in the order specified.

Note: That is, given the syntax string <code>"red | &lt;color>"</code>,
matching the value ''red'' against it will parse as an identifier,
while matching the value ''blue'' will parse as a <<color>>.

<div class='example'>
	:   <code>"&lt;length> | auto"</code>
	::  accepts a length, or auto
	:   <code>"foo | &lt;color># | &lt;integer>"</code>
	::  accepts foo, a comma-separated list of color values, or a single integer
</div>

Parsing the syntax string {#parsing-syntax}
-------------------------------------------

### Definitions ### {#parsing-definitions}

:   <dfn>data type name</dfn>
::  A sequence of <a>code points</a> consisting of a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;), followed be zero or more <a>name code points</a>, and terminated by U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (>).

:   <dfn>pre-multiplied data type name</dfn>
::  A [=data type name=] that represents another [=syntax component=] with a [[#multipliers|multiplier]] already included.

:   <dfn>syntax component</dfn>
::  An object consisting of a <a>syntax component name</a>, and an optional [[#multipliers|multiplier]].

:   <dfn>syntax component name</dfn>
::  A sequence of <a>code points</a> which is either a <a>data type name</a>,
	or a sequence that can produce a <<custom-ident>>.

:   <dfn>syntax descriptor</dfn>
::  An object consisting of a list of <a>syntax components</a>.

:   <dfn>universal syntax descriptor</dfn>
::  A special descriptor which accepts any valid token stream.

### Consume a syntax descriptor ### {#consume-syntax-descriptor}

<div algorithm>
	This section describes how to <dfn export>consume a syntax descriptor</dfn> from a [=string=] |string|.
	It either produces a <a>syntax descriptor</a>
	with a list of <a>syntax components</a>, or the <a>universal syntax descriptor</a>.

	1. [=Strip leading and trailing ASCII whitespace=] from |string|.

	2. If |string|’s [=string/length=] is 0,
		return failure.

	3. If |string|’s [=string/length=] is 1,
		and the only [=code point=] in |string| is U+002A ASTERISK (*),
		return the [=universal syntax descriptor=].

	4. Let |stream| be an [=input stream=] created from the [=code points=] of |string|,
		preprocessed as specified in [[css-syntax-3]].
		Let |descriptor| be an initially empty [=list=] of <a>syntax components</a>.

	5. <a>Consume a syntax component</a> from |stream|.
		If failure was returned,
		return failure;
		otherwise,
		[=list/append=] the returned value to |descriptor|.

		Consume as much <a>whitespace</a> as possible from |stream|.

		Consume the <a>next input code point</a> in |stream|:
		:   EOF
		:: return |descriptor|.

		:   U+007C VERTICAL LINE (|)
		:: Repeat step 5.

		:   Anything else:
		:: Return failure.

</div>

### Consume a syntax component ### {#consume-syntax-component}

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>consume a syntax component</dfn> from a stream of <a>code points</a> |stream|:

	Consume as much <a>whitespace</a> as possible from |stream|.

	Let |component| be a new <a>syntax component</a> with its |name| and |multiplier| initially
	empty.

	Consume the <a>next input code point</a> in |stream|:

	:   U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;)
	::  <a>Consume a data type name</a> from |stream|.
		If it returned a [=string=], set |component|'s |name| to the returned value.
		Otherwise, return failure.

	:   <a>name-start code point</a>
	:   U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS (\)
	::  If the stream [=starts with an identifier=],
		<a>reconsume the current input code point</a> from |stream|
		then [=consume a name=] from |stream|,
		and set |component|’s |name| to the returned value.
		Otherwise return failure.

		If |component|’s |name| does not [=CSS/parse=] as a <<custom-ident>>,
		return failure.

	:   anything else
	::  Return failure.

	If |component|’s |name| is a [=pre-multiplied data type name=],
	return |component|.

	If the [=next input code point=] in |stream|
	is U+002B PLUS SIGN (+)
	or U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#),
	consume the <a>next input code point</a> from |stream|,
	and set |component|’s |multiplier| to the [=current input code point=].

	Return |component|.
</div>

### Consume a data type name ### {#consume-data-type-name}

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>consume a data type name</dfn> from a stream of <a>code points</a>:

	Note: This algorithm assumes that a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) <a>code point</a> has already been consumed from the stream.

	Let |name| initially be a [=string=] containing a single U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) <a>code point</a>.

	Repeatedly consume the <a>next input code point</a>:

	:   U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (>)
	::  Append the <a>code point</a> to |name|.
		If |name| is a [=supported syntax component name=],
		return |name|.
		Otherwise return failure.

	:   <a>name code point</a>
	::  Append the <a>code point</a> to |name|.

	:   anything else
	::  Return failure.
</div>

Behavior of Custom Properties {#behavior-of-custom-properties}
==============================================================

Animation Behavior of Custom Properties {#animation-behavior-of-custom-properties}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: As defined by [[css3-animations]] and [[css3-transitions]], it is possible to
specify animations and transitions that reference custom properties.

When referenced by animations and transitions,
custom properties interpolate in a manner defined by their types.
If their type is defined as a list with "+",
it's interpolated as a simple list [[!css3-transitions]].

If the start and end of an interpolation have matching types, then they
will interpolate as specified in [[!css3-animations]].
Otherwise, the interpolation falls back to the default 50% flip described in
[[!css3-animations]].

Conditional Rules {#conditional-rules}
--------------------------------------

<div class=note>
	''@supports'' rules and the {{CSS/supports(conditionText)}} method
	behave as specified in [[!css-variables]],
	without distinguishing between registered and unregistered custom properties,
	and paying no attention to registered properties' syntaxes.

	{{CSS/supports(property, value)}},
	as specified in [[css-conditional-3]],
	<em>does</em> pay attention to the syntax of registered custom properties.

	The general principle in use
	is that anything which evaluates the validity of a CSS property value on its own
	will pay attention to the syntax of registered custom properties,
	but anything parsing any larger construct
	(such as declarations, or entire stylesheets)
	will ignore the syntax.
</div>

Relative URLs {#relative-urls}
------------------------------

Relative URL values that appear in registered custom properties are resolved
to full URLs as described in [[!css3-values]].

<div class='example'>
	Because URLs resolve against the base URL of the stylesheet they appear in, we can
	end up with multiple relative URLs that resolve against different base URLs, even though
	they appear in the same property.

	For example, suppose '--url-foo' and '--url-bar' are registered
	custom properties with ''&lt;url>'' syntax, and that we have a stylesheet at
	<code>/style/foo/foo.css</code>:

	<pre class='lang-css'>
	div {
		--url-foo: url("foo.png");
	}
	</pre>

	and another stylesheet at <code>/style/bar/bar.css</code>
	<pre class='lang-css'>
	div {
		--url-bar: url("bar.png");
	}
	</pre>

	and finally a document at <code>/index.html</code>:
	<pre class='lang-html'>
	&lt;link href="/style/foo/foo.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
	&lt;link href="/style/bar/bar.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
	&lt;div style="background-image: var(--url-foo), var(---url-bar);">
	&lt;/div>
	</pre>

	Here, the ''var(--url-foo)'' reference would produce a URL that resolves against
	<code>/style/foo</code>, and the ''var(--url-bar)'' reference would produce a URL that resolves
	against <code>/style/bar</code>.

</div>


Fallbacks in ''var()'' references {#fallbacks-in-var-references}
----------------------------------------------------------------

References to registered custom properties using the ''var()'' function may
provide a fallback. However, the fallback value must match the
<a>syntax descriptor</a> of the custom property being referenced, otherwise the
declaration is <a spec=css-variables>invalid at computed-value time</a>.

Note: This applies regardless of whether or not the fallback is being used.


Substitution {#substitution}
----------------------------

Like unregistered custom properties, the value of a registered custom property
can be substituted into another value with the ''var()'' function. However,
registered custom properties substitute as their
[[#calculation-of-computed-values|computed value]], rather than the original
token sequence used to produce that value.

Any ''var()'' function that references a registered custom property must be
replaced with an <dfn>equivalent token sequence</dfn>, which is equal
to the token sequence that
would have been produced by [[cssom#serialize-a-css-value|serializing]]
the computed value, and [[css-syntax-3#tokenization|tokenizing]] the resulting
string.

<div class='example'>
	Suppose that '--x' is registered with ''&lt;length>'' syntax, and that '--y'
	is an unregistered custom property.

	<pre class='lang-css'>

	div {
		font-size: 10px;
		--x: 8em;
		--y: var(--x);
	}
	</pre>

	Because the computed value of '--x' (when serialized)  is "80px", the computed
	value of '--y' is: <<whitespace-token>> followed by
	<<dimension-token>> with a value of '80' and unit 'px'.

</div>

CSSOM {#cssom}
==============

{{CSSStyleDeclaration}} Behavior {#css-style-declaration-behavior}
------------------------------------------------------------------

The <a>set a CSS declaration</a> algorithm gains an additional constraint
for registered custom properties:

* The target declaration must have a value that matches the registered
	[=syntax descriptor|syntax=] of the property.

This means that once a property is registered, it is not possible to use
{{setProperty()}} with a value that violates the registered syntax of the
property.

Note: Registering a property with a particular syntax
does not invalidate already-specified values for the property
(that is, they're not thrown out at parse-time,
like invalid properties usually are),
even if those would violate the registered syntax.
The registration <em>does</em> prevent new invalid values from being set,
and affects how the custom property calculates its [=computed value=].

<div class='example'>
	For example,
	in the following code snippet,
	the ''--x'' property is set to a value
	that doesn't match the later-registered syntax:

	<pre class="lang-javascript">
		document.body.style.setProperty('--x', '10px');
		CSS.registerProperty({
			name: '--x',
			syntax: '&lt;color>',
			initialValue: 'white',
			inherits: false
		});

		// This still outputs "10px", as existing values aren't
		// re-evaluated after a syntax is registered.
		console.log(document.body.style.getPropertyValue('--x'));

		// This silently fails, like any other property would
		// when one attempts to set it to an invalid value.
		document.body.style.setProperty('--x', '20px');

		// Because ''--x'' is still set to "10px", which isn't
		// a valid <<color>>, it will be "<l>[=invalid at computed-value time=]</l>",
		// falling back to the registered initial value of "white".
		// 'background-color' will then receive that color and get
		// set to "white".
		document.body.style.backgroundColor = "var(--x)";
	</pre>
</div>

{{CSSStyleValue}} Reification {#css-style-value-reification}
------------------------------------------------------------

<div algorithm>
	To <dfn>reify a registered custom property value</dfn> given a
	[=syntax descriptor=] |syntax|, run these steps:

	For specified values:

		1. If the value is a <<declaration-value>>, and |syntax| is not the
			[=universal syntax descriptor=], attempt to [=CSS/parse=]
			the value according to |syntax|. If this succeeds, [=reify=]
			the result as if it were a computed value, and return that result.
		2. Otherwise, [=reify a list of component values=] from the value, and
			return the result.

	For computed values:

		1. If the value is a <<length>>, <<integer>>, <<number>>, <<angle>>,
			<<time>>, <<resolution>>, <<percentage>> or <<length-percentage>>;
			[=reify a numeric value=] from the value and return the result.
		2. If the value is a <<transform-function>>,
			[=reify a &lt;transform-function>=] from the value and return the
			result.
		3. If the value is a <<transform-list>>,
			[=reify a &lt;transform-list>=] from the value and return the result.
		4. If the value is an <<image>>, reify a CSSImageValue from the value and
			return the result.
		5. If the value is an [=identifier=], [=reify an identifier=] from the value
			and return the result.
		6. If the value is a <<declaration-value>>,
			[=reify a list of component values=] from the value, and return the
			result.
		7. Otherwise, [=reify as a CSSStyleValue=] and return the result.
</div>
