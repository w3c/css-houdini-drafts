Level: 1
Abstract: Layout as described by CSS produces fragments that control how content is displayed and positioned. This specification describes an API for accessing information about these fragments.

<h2 id='intro'>Introduction</h2>

The layout stage of CSS is responsible for generating the position and size of
a document's content.  During this process, each DOM element produces
potentially many boxes, each of which in turn produce potentially many
fragments.

This specification describes an API that gives developers access to geometry,
text and other information about boxes and fragments.

<h2 id='boxes-and-fragments'>Boxes and Fragments</h2>

The [[!css-display-3]] specification describes the relationship between
elements, boxes, and fragments.

Elements and pseudo-elements generate zero or more fragments, each of which
generates a fragment tree.

Fragments do not in general form a tree that maps cleanly back to the DOM. When
an element generates multiple fragment trees, the element that generates a least common ancestor can be arbitrarily far up the DOM tree.

<div class='example'>
	Assuming that layout places "foo bar" on the first line, and "baz" on the
	second, the following HTML produces six fragments in a single tree.

	<pre class=lang-markup>
	&lt;style>
	p::first-line { color: green; }

	p::first-letter { color: red; }
	&lt;/style>
	&lt;p>foo &lt;i>bar baz&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
	</pre>

	The fragments are:

	* the first line box
	* the second line box
	* the first letter fragment, parented by the first line box and styled by the first-letter rule.
	* a fragment containing "oo", parented by the first line box and styled by the first-line rule.
	* a fragment containing "bar", parented by the first line box and italic.
	* a fragment containing "baz", parented by the second line box and italic.

	The italic element produces two fragments ("bar" and "baz"), each in its own
	tree. In this example, the paragraph element generates the common root for
	these fragments; however if (for example) the paragraph element were itself a
	descendant of a multi-column div then the common root may be further up the
	tree.
</div>

Boxes are not explicitly exposed by this API.
