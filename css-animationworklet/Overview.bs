Introduction {#intro}
=====================
<em>This section is not normative.</em>

This document introduces a new primitive that provides extensibility in web animations and enables
high performance interactive procedural animations on the web. For details on the rationale and
motivation see both [[explainer]] and [[principles]].

The <a>Animation Worklet</a> API provides a method to create scripted animations that control a set
of <a>animation effects</a>. The API is designed to make it possible for user agents to run such
animations in their own dedicated thread to provide a degree of performance isolation from main
thread.

Relationship to the Web Animations API {#relationship-to-web-animations}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Animations running inside an <a>Animation Worklet</a> execution context expose the {{Animation}}
interface from the Web Animations specification on the main javascript execution context. This means
they can be controlled and inspected from main thread using the same Web Animation APIs.


Animation Worklet {#animation-worklet-desc}
==============================
<dfn>Animation Worklet</dfn> is a {{Worklet}} responsible for all classes related to custom
animations. The worklet can be accessed via {{animationWorklet}} attribute.

The {{animationWorklet}}'s <a>worklet global scope type</a> is {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}.

{{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}} represents the global execution context of {{animationWorklet}}.

<xmp class='idl'>
[Exposed=Window]
partial namespace CSS {
    [SameObject] readonly attribute Worklet animationWorklet;
};
</xmp>



Animator {#animator-desc}
========

An <dfn>Animator</dfn> represents an animation instance that is running on the animation thread.
Animators are identified by a unique name and determine how the animation progresses its keyframe
effects given current input time. <a>Animator</a> instances live in {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}
and each one is associated with a {{WorkletAnimation}} instance. An animator can only be
instantiated by construction of a {{WorkletAnimation}}.


Two animators types are supported: {{StatelessAnimator}} and {{StatefulAnimator}} each
providing a different state management strategy.


StatelessAnimator Interface {#stateless-animator-desc}
---------------------------

This interface represents a stateless animator. This type of animator does not depend on any local
state either stored on the instance or global scope. Effectively, the animate function of an
{{StatelessAnimator}} can be treated as a pure function with the expectation that given the same
input, it produces the same output.



<xmp class='idl'>
[Exposed=AnimationWorklet, Global=AnimationWorklet, Constructor (optional any options)]
interface StatelessAnimator {
};
</xmp>



<div class='note'>
    This is how the class should look.
    <pre class='lang-javascript'>
        class FooAnimator extends StatelessAnimator {
            constructor(options) {
                // Called when a new animator is instantiated.
            }
            animate(currentTime, effect) {
                // Animation frame logic goes here.
            }
        }
    </pre>
</div>

Note: The statelessness allows an animation worklet to perform optimization such as producing
multiple animation frames in parallel and performing very cheap teardown and setup. Using
StatelessAnimator is highly recommended to enable such optimizations.

StatefulAnimator Interface {#stateful-animator-desc}
---------------------------

This interface represents a stateful animator. This animator can have local state and animation
worklet guarantees that it maintains this state as long as the stateful animator fulfills the
contract required by this interface as described following.


<a>Animation worklet</a> maintains a set of {{WorkletGlobalScope}}s which may exist across different
threads or processes. Animation worklet may temporarily terminate a global scope (e.g., to preserve
resources) or move a running <a>animator instance</a> across different global scopes (e.g., if its
effect is mutable only in a certain thread). Animation worklet guarantees that a stateful animator
instance's state is maintained even if the instance is respawned in a different global scope.

The basic mechanism for maintaining the state is that the animation worklet snapshots the local
state that is exposed via the {{StatefulAnimator/state}} function and then reifies it so that it can
be passed into the constructor when the animator instance is respawned at a later time in a
potentially different global scope. The <a>migrate an animator instance</a> algorithm specifies this
process in details.

A user-defined stateful animator is expected to fulfill the required contract which is that its
state function returns an object representing its state that can be serialized using structured
serialized algorithm and that it can also recreate its state given that same object passed to
its constructor.

<xmp class='idl'>
[Exposed=AnimationWorklet, Global=AnimationWorklet,
Constructor (optional any options, optional any state)]
interface StatefulAnimator {
  any state();
};
</xmp>


<div class='note'>
    This is how the class should look.
    <pre class='lang-javascript'>
        class BarAnimator extends StatefulAnimator {
            constructor(options, state) {
              // Called when a new animator is instantiated (either first time or after being respawned).
              this.currentVelocity  = state ? state.velocity : 0;
            }
            animate(currentTime, effect) {
                // Animation frame logic goes here and can rely on this.currentVelocity.
                this.currentVelocity += 0.1;
            }
            state() {
              // The returned object should be serializable using structured clonable algorithm.
              return {
                velocity: this.currentVelocity;
              }
            }
        }
    </pre>
</div>


Animator Definition {#animator-definition-desc}
-------------------

An <dfn>animator definition</dfn> is a <a>struct</a> which describes the author defined custom
animation as needed by {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}. It consists of:

 - An <dfn>animator name</dfn> <<ident>>#.

 - A <dfn>class constructor</dfn> which is a {{AnimatorInstanceConstructor}} <a>callback function</a> type.

 - An <dfn>animate function</dfn> which is a <a>Function</a> <a>callback function</a> type.

 - A <dfn>stateful flag</dfn>



Registering an Animator Definition {#registering-animator-definition}
-------------------------------------
An {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}} has a <dfn>animator name to animator definition map</dfn>.
The map gets populated when {{registerAnimator(name, animatorCtor)}} is called.


<xmp class='idl'>

[ Global=(Worklet,AnimationWorklet), Exposed=AnimationWorklet ]
interface AnimationWorkletGlobalScope : WorkletGlobalScope {
    void registerAnimator(DOMString name, AnimatorInstanceConstructor animatorCtor);
};

callback AnimatorInstanceConstructor = any (any options, optional any state);

</xmp>

<div algorithm="register-animator">

When the <dfn method for=AnimationWorkletGlobalScope>registerAnimator(|name|, |animatorCtor|)</dfn>
method is called in a {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}, the user agent <em>must</em> run the
following steps:

    1. If |name| is not a valid <<ident>>, <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a> and abort all these
        steps.

    2. If |name| exists as a key in the <a>animator name to animator definition map</a>,
        <a>throw</a> a <a>NotSupportedError</a> and abort all these steps.

    3. If the result of <a>IsConstructor</a>(|animatorCtor|) is <b>false</b>, <a>throw</a> a
        <a>TypeError</a> and abort all these steps.


    4. Let |prototype| be the result of <a>Get</a>(|animatorCtor|, "prototype").


    5. If <a>SameValue</a>(|prototype|, {{StatelessAnimator}}) is <b>true</b> set |stateful| to be
        <b>false</b>, otherwise if <a>SameValue</a>(|prototype|, {{StatefulAnimator}}) is
        <b>true</b> set |stateful| to be <b>true</b>, otherwise <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a> and
        abort all these steps.

    6. Let |animateValue| be the result of <a>Get</a>(|prototype|, "animate").

    7. Let |animate| be the result of <a>converting</a> |animateValue| to the <a>Function</a>
        <a>callback function</a> type. If an exception is thrown, rethrow the exception and abort
        all these steps.

    8. Let |definition| be a new <a>animator definition</a> with:

        - <a>animator name</a> being |name|

        - <a>class constructor</a> being |animatorCtor|

        - <a>animate function</a> being |animate|

        - <a>stateful flag</a> being |stateful|


    9. Add the key-value pair (|name| - |definition|) to the <a>animator name to animator
        definition map</a>.
</div>


Animator Instance {#animator-instance-section}
======================================

An <dfn>animator instance</dfn> is a <a>struct</a> which describes a fully realized custom animation
instance in an {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}. It has a reference to an <a>animator definition</a>
and owns the instance specific state such as animation effect and timeline. It consists of:

 - An <a>animator name</a>.

 - An <a>animation requested flag</a>.

 - An <dfn>animator effect</dfn> which is an <a>animation effect</a>.

 - An <dfn>animator current time</dfn> which is the corresponding <a>worklet animation</a>'s current
     time.

 - An <dfn>animator timeline</dfn> which is a <a>timeline</a>.

 - An <dfn>animator serialized options</dfn> which is a serializable object.

A <dfn>stateful animator instance</dfn> is an <a>animator instance</a> whose corresponding
<a>animator definition</a>'s <a>stateful flag</a> is <b>true</b>.


Creating an Animator Instance {#creating-animator-instance}
-----------------------------------------------------------

Each <a>animator instance</a> lives in an {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}.

Each {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}} has an <dfn>animator instance set</dfn>. The set is populated
when the user agent constructs a new <a>animator instance</a> in the {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}}
scope. Each <a>animator instance</a> corresponds to a worklet animation in the document scope.

<div algorithm="create-animator">

To <dfn>create a new animator instance</dfn> given a |name|, |timeline|, |effect|, |serializedOptions|,
|serializedState|, and |workletGlobalScope|, the user agent <em>must</em> run the following steps:

    1. Let the |definition| be the result of looking up |name| on the |workletGlobalScope|'s
         <a>animator name to animator definition map</a>.

          If |definition| does not exist abort the following steps.

    2. Let |animatorCtor| be the <a>class constructor</a> of |definition|.

    3. Let |options| be <a>StructuredDeserialize</a>(|serializedOptions|).

    4. Let |state| be <a>StructuredDeserialize</a>(|serializedState|).

    5. Let |animatorInstance| be the result of <a>constructing</a> |animatorCtor| with
        «|options|, |state|» as arguments. If an exception is thrown, rethrow the exception and
        abort all these steps.

    6. Set the following on |animatorInstance| with:
        - <a>animator name</a> being |name|
        - <a>animation requested flag</a> being <a>frame-current</a>
        - <a>animator current time</a> being unresolved
        - <a>animator effect</a> being |effect|
        - <a>animator timeline</a> being |timeline|
        - <a>animator serialized options</a> being |options|

    7. Add |animatorInstance| to |workletGlobalScope|'s <a>animator instance set</a>.

</div>


Running Animators {#running-animators}
--------------------------------------

When the user agent wants to produce a new animation frame, if for any <a>animator instance</a> the
associated <a>animation requested flag</a> is <a>frame-requested</a> then the the user agent
<em>must</em> <a>run animators</a> for the current frame.

Note: The user agent is not required to run animations on every visual frame. It is legal to defer
      generating an animation frame until a later frame. This allow the user agent to
      provide a different service level according to their policy.

<div algorithm="run-animators">

When the user agent wants to <dfn>run animators</dfn> in a given |workletGlobalScope|, it
<em>must</em> iterate over all <a>animator instance</a>s in the |workletGlobalScope|'s <a>animator
instance set</a>. For each such |instance| the user agent <em>must</em> perform the following steps:

  1. Let |animatorName| be |instance|'s <a>animator name</a>

  2. Let the |definition| be the result of looking up |animatorName| on the |workletGlobalScope|'s
        <a>animator name to animator definition map</a>.

      If |definition| does not exist then abort the following steps.

  3. If the <a>animation requested flag</a> for |instance| is <a>frame-current</a> or the effect
       belonging to the |instance| will not be visible within the visual viewport of the current
       frame the user agent <em>may</em> abort all the following steps.

       Issue: Consider giving user agents permission to skip running animator instances to
       throttle slow animators.

  4. Let |animateFunction| be |definition|'s <a>animate function</a>.

  5. Let |currentTime| be <a>animator current time</a> of |instance|.

  6. Let |effect| be <a>animator effect</a> of |instance|.

  7. <a>Invoke</a> |animateFunction| with arguments «|currentTime|, |effect|»,
        and with |instance| as the <a>callback this value</a>.

</div>
Note: Although inefficient, it is legal for the user agent to <a>run animators</a> multiple times
in the same frame.


Issue: should be explicit as to what happens if the animateFunction throws an exception. At least
we should have wording that the localTime values of the keyframes are ignored to avoid incorrect
partial updates.

Removing an Animator Instance {#removing-animator}
-----------------------------------------

<div algorithm="remove-animator">

To <dfn>remove an animator instance</dfn> given |instance| and |workletGlobalScope| the user agent
<em>must</em> run the following steps:

1. Remove |instance| from |workletGlobalScope|'s <a>animator instance set</a>.

</div>


Migrating an Animator Instance {#migrating-animator}
-----------------------------------------

The migration process allows <a>stateful animator instance</a> to be migrated to a different
{{WorkletGlobalScope}} without losing their local state.

<div algorithm="migrate-animator">

To <dfn>migrate an animator instance</dfn> from one {{WorkletGlobalScope}} to another, given
|instance|, |sourceWorkletGlobalScope|, |destinationWorkletGlobalScope|, the user agent
<em>must</em> run the following steps :

  1. Let |serializedState| be undefined.

  2. <a>Queue a task</a> on |sourceWorkletGlobalScope| to run the following steps:

     1. Let |animatorName| be |instance|'s <a>animator name</a>

     2. Let |definition| be the result of looking up |animatorName| on |sourceWorkletGlobalScope|'s
        <a>animator name to animator definition map</a>.

        If |definition| does not exist then abort the following steps.

     3. Let |stateful| be the <a>stateful flag</a> of |definition|.

     4. If |stateful| is <b>false</b> then abort the following steps.

     4. |stateFunction|
     5. Let |state| be the result of <a>Invoke</a> |stateFunction| with |instance| as the
        <a>callback this value</a>.  If any exception is thrown, rethrow the exception and abort
        the following steps.

     6. Set |serializedState| to be the result of <a>StructuredSerialize</a>(|state|).
        If any exception is thrown, then abort the following steps.

     7. Run the procedure to <a>remove an animator instance</a> given |instance|, and
        |sourceWorkletGlobalScope|.

  2. Wait for the above task to complete. If the task is aborted, abort the following steps.

  3. <a>Queue a task</a> on |destinationWorkletGlobalScope| to run the following steps:

     1. Run the procedure to <a>create a new animator instance</a> given:
        - The |instance|'s <a>animator name</a> as name.
        - The |instance|'s <a>animator timeline</a> as timeline.
        - The |instance|'s <a>animator effect</a> as effect.
        - The |instance|'s <a>animator serialized options</a> as options.
        - The |serializedState| as state.
        - The |destinationWorkletGlobalScope| as workletGlobalScope.

</div>

If an animator state getter throws the user agent will remove the animator but does not recreate it.
This effectively removes the animator instance.


Requesting Animation Frames {#requesting-animation-frames}
----------------------------------------------------------

Each <a>animator instance</a> has an associated <dfn>animation requested flag</dfn>. It must be
either <dfn>frame-requested</dfn> or <dfn>frame-current</dfn>. It is initially set to
<a>frame-current</a>. Different circumstances can cause the <a>animation requested flag</a> to be
set to <a>frame-requested</a>. These include the following:
  - Changes in the <a>current time</a> of the animator's <a>timeline</a>
  - Changes in the <a>current time</a> of the animator's corresponding <a>Worklet Animation</a>

[[#running-animators]] resets the <a>animation requested flag</a> on animators to
<a>frame-current</a>.


Web Animations Integration {#web-animation-integration}
===============================


Worklet Animation {#worklet-animation-desc}
-------------------------------------------
<dfn>Worklet animation</dfn> is a kind of <a>animation</a> that delegates the animation playback to
an <a>animator instance</a>. It controls the lifetime and playback state of its corresponding
<a>animator instance</a>.

Being an <a>animation</a>, <a>worklet animation</a> has an <a>animation effect</a> and a
<a>timeline</a>. However unlike other animations the worklet animation's <a>current time</a> does
not directly determine the animation effect's <a>local time</a> (via its <a>inherited time</a>).
Instead the associated <a>animator instance</a> controls the animation effect's <a>local time</a>
directly. Note that this means that the <a>timeline's</a> current time does not fully determine the
animation's output.

<a>Worklet animation</a> has the following properties in addition to the {{Animation}} interface:
  - an <dfn>animation animator name</dfn> which identifies its <a>animator definition</a>.
  - a <dfn>serialized options</dfn> which is serializable object that is used when
    constructing a new animator instance.

  <img src="img/WorkletAnimation-timing-model.svg" width="600"
    alt="Overview of the WorkletAnimation timing model.">
  <figcaption>
    Overview of the WorkletAnimation timing model. <br>

    The animation current time is input to the animator instance, which produces a local time value
    for the animation effect. If the animator instance is running in a parallel global scope the
    implementation may also choose to use the local time value to produce the final effect value and
    update the visuals in parallel.

Worklet Animation timing model {#timing-model}
------------------------------------

This section describes how <a>worklet animation's</a> timing model differs from other
<a>animations</a>.

In addition to the existing conditions on when the <a>animation</a> is considered <a>ready</a>, a
<a>worklet animation</a> is only considered <a>ready</a> when the following condition is also true:

  - the user agent has completed any setup required to create the <a>worklet animation's</a>
     corresponding <a>animator instance</a>.

As described in [[#worklet-animation-desc]], the <a>worklet animation's</a> <a>current time</a> does
not determine its <a>animation effect's</a> <a>local time</a>. Instead the associated <a>animator
instance</a> controls the animation effect's <a>local time</a> directly. This means that the
animation effect's local time is controlled from a {{WorkletGlobalScope}} which may be in a parallel
execution context.

Here are a few implications of the above semantics:

 - Setting the <a>current time</a> or <a>start time</a> of a <a>worklet animation</a> does not
    necessarily change its output, but may change the animation <a>play state</a>.
 - Similarly, invoking {{Animation/finish()}} or updating a <a>worklet animation's</a> <a>playback
    rate</a> will only change the animation <a>play state</a> and may not change the output.
 - Querying the animation effect's local time using {{AnimationEffect/getComputedTiming()}}
    may return stale information, in the case where the <a>animator instance</a> is running in a
    parallel execution context.

If a Worklet Animation animation is executing in a parallel worklet execution context, the last
known state of its animation effects should be periodically synced back to the main javascript
execution context. The synchronization of <a>effect values</a> from the parallel worklet execution
context to the main javascript execution context <em>must</em> occur before <a>running the animation
frame callbacks</a> as part of the document lifecycle. Note that due to the asynchronous nature of
this animation model a script running in the main javascript execution context may see a stale value
when reading a <a>target property</a> that is being animated by a Worklet Animation, compared to the
value currently being used to produce the visual frame that is visible to the user. This is similar
to the effect of asynchronous scrolling when reading scroll offsets in the main javascript execution
context.

Issue(811): Come with appropriate mechanism's for <a>animator instance</a> to get notified when its
   animation currentTime is changing e.g., via reverse(), finish() or playbackRate change. So that
   it can react appropriately.


Interaction with Animator Instances {#worklet-animation-animator-instances}
-----------------------------------

A <a>worklet animation</a> corresponds to at most one <a>animator instance</a> at any time, and may
have no current corresponding <a>animator instance</a>. The correspondance of an <a>animator
instance</a> for a <a>worklet animation</a> depends on the animation <a>play state</a>.

<div algorithm="associate-animator-instance">

To <dfn>associate animator instance of worklet animation</dfn> given |workletAnimation|,
the user agent <em>must</em> run the following steps:

  1. If |workletAnimation| has a corresponding <a>animator instance</a>, abort the following steps.
  2. Let |workletGlobalScope| be the {{AnimationWorkletGlobalScope}} associated with
    |workletAnimation|.
  3. <a>Queue a task</a> on |workletGlobalScope| to run the procedure to <a>create a new animator
       instance</a>, passing:

      * The |workletAnimation|'s <a>serialized options</a> as options.
      * The |workletGlobalScope| as workletGlobalScope.
  4. If the procedure was successful, set the resulting <a>animator instance</a> as corresponding to
    |workletAnimation|.

ScrollTimeline {#scroll-timeline}
---------------------------------
<em>This section is not normative.</em>


{{ScrollTimeline}} is a new concept being proposed for addition to web animation API. It defines
an animation timeline whose time value depends on the scroll position of a scroll container.
<a>Worklet animations</a> can have a scroll timeline and thus drive their scripted effects based
on a scroll offset.

Note: <strong>Access to input</strong>: We are interested on exposing additional user input beside
scrolling (e.g., touch/pointer input) to these animations so that authors can create jank-free
input driven animations which are not really possible today. We are still trying to figure out the
right abstractions and mechanisms to do this.

WorkletGroupEffect {#worklet-group-effect}
------------------

{{WorkletGroupEffect}} is a type of <a>group effect</a> that allows its <a>child effect's</a>
<a>local times</a> to be mutated individually.

When a {{WorkletGroupEffect}} is set as the <a>animation effect</a> of a {{WorkletAnimation}}, the
corresponding <a>animator instance</a> can directly control the <a>child effects</a>' <a>local
times</a>. This allows a single worklet animation to coordinate multiple effects - see
[[#example-2]] for an example of such a use-case.

<xmp class='idl'>
[Exposed=AnimationWorklet]
interface WorkletGroupEffect {
  sequence<AnimationEffect> getChildren();
};

[Exposed=AnimationWorklet]
partial interface AnimationEffect {
    // Intended for use inside Animation Worklet scope to drive the effect.
    attribute double localTime;
};
</xmp>

<div algorithm="set-local-time">

To set the {{localTime}} property on a |effect| to value |t|, the user agent should perform the
action that corresponds to the first matching condition from the following:

 :  If the |effect| does not have a parent group,
 :: Set the |effect| local time to |t|.
 :  If the |effect| has a parent group and it is of {{WorkletGroupEffect}} type,
 :: Set the effect start time to (parent's transformed time - t). Note this effectively set's the
    |effect|'s local time to t.
 :  Otherwise
 :: Throw an exception indicating that the child effect time can only be controlled by
    its parent group.

</div>

Issue(w3c/csswg-drafts#2071): The above interface exposes a conservative subset
of GroupEffect proposed as part of web-animation-2. We should instead move this
into a delta spec against the web-animation.


Effect Stack and Composite Order {#effect-stack-composite-order}
--------------------------------

As with other animations, <a>worklet animations</a> participate in the <a>effect stack</a>.  A
worklet animation does not have a specific <a>animation class</a> which means it has the same
composite order as other Javascript created web animations.

      startScrollOffset: 0,
      endScrollOffset: $header.clientHeight}));
animation.play();

    this.timing_ = new CubicBezier('ease-out');
  }

  animate(currentTime, effect) {
    const scroll = currentTime;  // scroll is in [0, 1000] range

    // Drive the output group effect by setting its children local times individually.
    effect.children[0].localTime = scroll;
    effect.children[1].localTime = this.timing_(clamp(scroll, 0, 500));
  }
});

function clamp(value, min, max) {
  return Math.min(Math.max(value, min), max);
}
